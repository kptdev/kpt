Hi @liamfallon! I'd like to work on this issue.

I've reviewed PR #4355 (the code transfer) and explored both the `kpt` and Porch repositories. Before I start moving documentation, I need clarification on which specific documentation should be transferred from Porch to kpt:

**Questions:**

1. **Which documentation files/sections** should be moved? The current Porch docs at https://docs.porch.nephio.org/ seem to be Porch-specific (e.g., API server, repositories, packages). Are there specific sections that are actually kpt-related?

2. **What should I look for?** Should I focus on:
   - API documentation that was updated in Porch?
   - User guides that apply to kpt functionality?
   - Function documentation?
   - Something else?

3. **Where is the source?** Should I look at:
   - The Porch documentation source in `nephio-project/porch/docs/`?
   - Or another location?

I'm ready to help, but I want to make sure I'm moving the right content! Could you point me to the specific files or sections I should focus on?

Thanks!
