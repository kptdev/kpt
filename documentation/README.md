[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/57cfe7e6-fce7-4a0e-b00b-f6cc68b3f506/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/kptdocs/deploys)

This directory contains a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) web site published via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to
<https://kptdocs.netlify.app> what is redirected to <https://kpt.dev/>.

When the `main` branch of this repo is updated a fresh build and deploy of the website is executed. Recent Netlify
builds and deployments are listed at <https://app.netlify.com/sites/kptdocs>.

Add content by adding Markdown files to directories in [./content](./content).

Update layouts for each content type in [./layouts](./layouts/).

Configuration is set in [config.toml](./config.toml).

## Setting up a local dev instance

To set up a local dev environment make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, then run the following
from this folder:

```sh
npm install
```

Then run the site using `npm run serve`. To have the site run locally with a functioning local search, run
`npm run serve:with-pagefind`.
