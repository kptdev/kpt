### Describe your problem

Please describe your problem and specific use case, providing as much context as
possible. As a general rule, it is more effective to focus on describing the
_problem_ instead of asking for a specific _solution_. This ensures the
following:

1. We understand _WHY_ you are asking for this.
2. We can pattern match across multiple users with this problem.
3. Allow design freedom for addressing the problem given various trade-offs and
   UX considerations.
