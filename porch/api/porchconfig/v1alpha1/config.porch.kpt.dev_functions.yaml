          Function resources are created automatically by discovery in a registered
          Repository. Function resource names will be computed as <Repository Name>:<Function
          Name> to ensure uniqueness of names, and will follow formatting of [DNS
          Subdomain Names](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names).
