The ` + "`" + `pkg` + "`" + ` command group contains subcommands which read remote upstream
git repositories, and write local directories.  They are focused on
providing porcelain on top of workflows which would otherwise require
wrapping git to pull clone subdirectories and perform updates by merging
resources rather than files.
`
var PkgExamples = `
  # create your workspace
  $ mkdir hello-world-workspace
  $ cd hello-world-workspace
  $ git init
  
  # get the package
  $ export SRC_REPO=https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt.git
  $ kpt pkg get $SRC_REPO/package-examples/helloworld-set@v0.3.0 helloworld

var DiffShort = `Diff a local package against upstream`
var DiffLong = `
  kpt pkg diff [DIR@VERSION]

Args:

  DIR:
    Local package to compare. Command will fail if the directory doesn't exist, or does not
    contain a Kptfile.  Defaults to the current working directory.
  
  VERSION:
    A git tag, branch, ref or commit. Specified after the local_package with @ -- pkg_dir@version.
    Defaults to the local package version that was last fetched.

Flags:

  --diff-type:
    The type of changes to view (local by default). Following types are
    supported:
  
    local: shows changes in local package relative to upstream source package
           at original version
    remote: shows changes in upstream source package at target version
            relative to original version
    combined: shows changes in local package relative to upstream source
              package at target version
    3way: shows changes in local package and source package at target version
          relative to original version side by side
  
  --diff-tool:
    Commandline tool (diff by default) for showing the changes.
    Note that it overrides the KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF environment variable.
    
    # Show changes using 'meld' commandline tool
    kpt pkg diff @master --diff-tool meld
  
  --diff-opts:
    Commandline options to use with the diffing tool.
    Note that it overrides the KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF_OPTS environment variable.
    # Show changes using "diff" with recurive options
    kpt pkg diff @master --diff-tool meld --diff-opts "-r"

Environment Variables:

  KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF:
     Commandline diffing tool (diff by default) that will be used to show
     changes.
     # Use meld to show changes
     KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=meld kpt pkg diff
  
  KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF_OPTS:
     Commandline options to use for the diffing tool. For ex.
     # Using "-a" diff option
     KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF_OPTS="-a" kpt pkg diff --diff-tool meld
`

  # target version
  kpt pkg diff @v4.0.0 --diff-type remote

  # Show changes in current package relative to target version
  kpt pkg diff @v4.0.0 --diff-type combined

  # Show 3way changes between the local package, upstream package at original
  # version and upstream package at target version using meld

  REPO_URI:
    URI of a git repository containing 1 or more packages as subdirectories.
    In most cases the .git suffix should be specified to delimit the REPO_URI
    from the PKG_PATH, but this is not required for widely recognized repo
    prefixes.  If get cannot parse the repo for the directory and version,
    then it will print an error asking for '.git' to be specified as part of

    Specify - to read Resources from stdin and write to a LOCAL_DEST_DIRECTORY
  
  PKG_PATH:
    Path to remote subdirectory containing Kubernetes resource configuration
    files or directories. Defaults to the root directory.
    Uses '/' as the path separator (regardless of OS).

    to fetch.  Defaults to the repository master branch.
