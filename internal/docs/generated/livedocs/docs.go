var LiveShort = `Deploy local packages to a cluster.`
var LiveLong = `
The ` + "`" + `live` + "`" + ` command group contains subcommands for deploying local
` + "`" + `kpt` + "`" + ` packages to a cluster.
`

var ApplyShort = `Apply a package to the cluster (create, update, prune).`
var ApplyLong = `
  kpt live apply [PKG_PATH | -] [flags]

Args:

  PKG_PATH | -:
    Path to the local package which should be applied to the cluster. It must
    contain a Kptfile with inventory information. Defaults to the current working
    directory.
    Using '-' as the package path will cause kpt to read resources from stdin.

Flags:

  --dry-run:
    It true, kpt will validate the resources in the package and print which
    resources will be applied and which resources will be pruned, but no resources
    will be changed.
    If the --server-side flag is true, kpt will do a server-side dry-run, otherwise
    it will be a client-side dry-run. Note that the output will differ somewhat
    between the two alternatives.
  
  --field-manager:
    Identifier for the **owner** of the fields being applied. Only usable
    when --server-side flag is specified. Default value is kubectl.
  
  --force-conflicts:
    Force overwrite of field conflicts during apply due to different field
    managers. Only usable when --server-side flag is specified.
    Default value is false (error and failure when field managers conflict).
  
  --install-resource-group:
    Install the ResourceGroup CRD into the cluster if it isn't already
    available. Default is false.
  
  --inventory-policy:
    Determines how to handle overlaps between the package being currently applied
    and existing resources in the cluster. The available options are:
  
      * strict: If any of the resources already exist in the cluster, but doesn't
        belong to the current package, it is considered an error.
      * adopt: If a resource already exist in the cluster, but belongs to a
        different package, it is considered an error. Resources that doesn't belong
        to other packages are adopted into the current package.
  
    The default value is ` + "`" + `strict` + "`" + `.
  
  --output:
    Determines the output format for the status information. Must be one of the following:
  
      * events: The output will be a list of the status events as they become available.
      * json: The output will be a list of the status events as they become available,
        each formatted as a json object.
      * table: The output will be presented as a table that will be updated inline
        as the status of resources become available.
  
    The default value is ‘events’.
  
  --poll-period:
    The frequency with which the cluster will be polled to determine
    the status of the applied resources. The default value is 2 seconds.
  
  --prune-propagation-policy:
    The propagation policy that should be used when pruning resources. The
    default value here is 'Background'. The other options are 'Foreground' and 'Orphan'.
  
  --prune-timeout:
    The threshold for how long to wait for all pruned resources to be
    deleted before giving up. If this flag is not set, kpt live apply will wait
    until interrupted. In most cases, it would also make sense to set the
    --prune-propagation-policy to Foreground when this flag is set.
  
  --reconcile-timeout:
    The threshold for how long to wait for all resources to reconcile before
    giving up. If this flag is not set, kpt live apply will wait until
    interrupted.
  
  --server-side:
    Perform the apply operation server-side rather than client-side.
    Default value is false (client-side).
  
  --show-status-events:
    The output will include the details on the reconciliation status
    for all resources. Default is ` + "`" + `false` + "`" + `.
  
    Does not apply for the ` + "`" + `table` + "`" + ` output format.
`
var ApplyExamples = `

    Path to the local package which should be deleted from the cluster. It must
    contain a Kptfile with inventory information. Defaults to the current working
    directory.
    Using '-' as the package path will cause kpt to read resources from stdin.

Flags:

  --dry-run:
    It true, kpt will print the resources that will be removed from the cluster,
    but no resources will be deleted.
  
  --inventory-policy:
    Determines how to handle overlaps between the package being currently applied
    and existing resources in the cluster. The available options are:

        belong to the current package, it is considered an error.

        to other packages are adopted into the current package.

    for the package. Defaults to the name of the package.
  
  --namespace:
    The namespace for the ResourceGroup resource that contains the inventory

    in the package belong in the same namespace. If they do, that namespace will
    be used. If they do not, the namespace in the user's context will be chosen.
