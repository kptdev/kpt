Live contains the next-generation versions of apply related commands for
deploying local configuration packages to a cluster.
`

var ApplyShort = `Apply a package to the cluster (create, update, delete)`
var ApplyLong = `
  kpt live apply DIR [flags]

Args:
  DIR:
    Path to a package directory.  The directory must contain exactly
    one ConfigMap with the grouping object annotation.

Flags::
  --wait-for-reconcile:
    If true, after all resources have been applied, the cluster will
    be polled until either all resources have been fully reconciled
    or the timeout is reached.
  
  --wait-polling-period:
    The frequency with which the cluster will be polled to determine 
    the status of the applied resources. The default value is every 2 seconds.
  
  --wait-timeout:
    The threshold for how long to wait for all resources to reconcile before
    giving up. The default value is 1 minute.
`
var ApplyExamples = `
  # apply resources and prune
  kpt live apply my-dir/

  # apply resources and wait for all the resources to be reconciled before pruning
  kpt live apply --wait-for-reconcile my-dir/

  # apply resources and specify how long to wait for resources to be reconciled
  kpt live apply --wait-for-reconcile --wait-timeout=15m my-dir/

  # apply resources and specify how often to poll the cluster for resource status
  kpt live apply --wait-for-reconcile --wait-polling-period=5s my-dir/
`

var DestroyShort = `Remove all previously applied resources in a package from the cluster`
var DestroyLong = `
  kpt live destroy DIR

Args:
  DIR:
    Path to a package directory.  The directory must contain exactly
    one ConfigMap with the grouping object annotation.
`
var DestroyExamples = `
  # remove all resources in a package from the cluster
  kpt live destroy my-dir/
`

var InitShort = `Initialize a package with a object to track previously applied resources`
var InitLong = `
  kpt live init DIRECTORY [flags]

Args:
  DIR:
    Path to a package directory.  The directory must contain exactly
    one ConfigMap with the grouping object annotation.

Flags:
  --group-name:
    String name to group applied resources. Must be composed of valid
    label value characters. If not specified, the default group name
    is generated from the package directory name.
`
var InitExamples = `
  # initialize a package
  kpt live init my-dir/

  # initialize a package with a specific name for the group of resources
  kpt live init --group-name=foo my-dir/
`

var PreviewShort = `Preview prints the changes apply would make to the cluster`
var PreviewLong = `
  kpt live preview DIRECTORY [flags]

Args:
  DIRECTORY:
    One directory that contain k8s manifests. The directory
    must contain exactly one ConfigMap with the grouping object annotation.

Flags:
  --destroy:
    If true, dry-run deletion of all resources.
`
var PreviewExamples = `
  # preview apply for a package
  kpt live preview my-dir/

  # preview destroy for a package
  kpt live preview --destroy my-dir/
