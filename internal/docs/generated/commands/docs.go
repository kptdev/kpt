` + "`" + `desc` + "`" + ` reads package information in given DIRs and displays it in tabular format.
Input can be a list of package directories (defaults to the current directory if not specifed).
Any directory with a Kptfile is considered to be a package.

var DiffShort = `Show changes between local and upstream source package`
var DiffLong = `
Show changes between local and upstream source package.

Diff commands lets you answer the following questions:
  - What have I changed in my package relative to the upstream source package
  - What has changed in the upstream source package between the original source version and target version

You can specify a diffing tool with options to show the changes. By default, it
uses 'diff' commandline tool.

Args:

  LOCAL_PKG_DIR:
    Local package to compare. Command will fail if the directory doesn't exist, or does not
    contain a Kptfile.  Defaults to the current working directory.

  VERSION:
    A git tag, branch, ref or commit. Specified after the local_package with @ -- pkg_dir@version.
    Defaults to the local package version that was last fetched.

Envs:

  KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF:
   Commandline diffing tool (diff by default) that will be used to show changes. For ex.
   # Use meld to show changes
   KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=meld kpt diff

  KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF_OPTS:
   Commandline options to use for the diffing tool. For ex.
   # Using "-a" diff option
   KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF_OPTS="-a" kpt diff --diff-tool meld

Flags:
  diff-type:
    The type of changes to view (local by default). Following types are supported:
	 local: shows changes in local package relative to upstream source package at original version
	 remote: shows changes in upstream source package at target version relative to original version
	 combined: shows changes in local package relative to upstream source package at target version
	 3way: shows changes in local package and source package at target version relative to original version side by side

  diff-tool:
    Commandline tool (diff by default) for showing the changes.
	# Show changes using 'meld' commandline tool
	kpt diff @master --diff-tool meld

	Note that it overrides the KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF environment variable.

  diff-opts:
    Commandline options to use with the diffing tool.
	# Show changes using "diff" with recurive options
	kpt diff @master --diff-tool meld --diff-opts "-r"

	Note that it overrides the KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF_OPTS environment variable.

    kpt get REPO_URI[.git]/PKG_PATH[@VERSION] LOCAL_DEST_DIRECTORY [flags]

  REPO_URI:

    URI of a git repository containing 1 or more packages as subdirectories.
    In most cases the .git suffix should be specified to delimit the REPO_URI from the PKG_PATH,
    but this is not required for widely recognized repo prefixes.  If get cannot parse the repo

    Specify - to read Resources from stdin and write to a LOCAL_DEST_DIRECTORY.

  PKG_PATH:

    Defaults to the root directory.
    Uses '/' as the path separator (regardless of OS).
    e.g. staging/cockroachdb

  VERSION:

    A git tag, branch, ref or commit for the remote version of the package to fetch.
    Defaults to the repository master branch.
    e.g. @master

  LOCAL_DEST_DIRECTORY:

    e.g. ./my-cockroachdb-copy

Initialize suggested package meta for a local config directory.

Any directory containing Kubernetes Resource Configuration may be treated as
remote package without the existence of additional packaging metadata.

* DIR must be pushed to a git repo or repo subdirectory.

Init will augment an existing local directory with packaging metadata to help

Init will:

* Create a Kptfile with package name and metadata if it doesn't exist
* Create a README.md for package documentation if it doesn't exist.

var SyncShort = `Sync package dependencies using a manifest`
var SyncLong = `
Sync uses a manifest to manage a collection of dependencies.

The manifest declares *all* direct dependencies of a package in a Kptfile.
When ` + "`" + `sync` + "`" + ` is run, it will ensure each dependency has been fetched at the
specified ref.

This is an alternative to managing package dependencies individually using
the ` + "`" + `get` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `update` + "`" + ` commands.

    kpt sync LOCAL_PKG_DIR [flags]

  LOCAL_PKG_DIR:
  
    Local package with dependencies to sync.  Directory must exist and contain a Kptfile.

#### Env Vars

  KPT_CACHE_DIR:
  
    Controls where to cache remote packages during updates.
    Defaults to ~/.kpt/repos/
    
#### Dependencies

For each dependency in the Kptfile, ` + "`" + `sync` + "`" + ` will ensure that it exists locally with the
matching repo and ref.

Dependencies are specified in the ` + "`" + `Kptfile` + "`" + ` ` + "`" + `dependencies` + "`" + ` field and can be added or updated
with ` + "`" + `kpt sync set` + "`" + `.  e.g.

    kpt sync set https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt.git/package-examples/hello-world \
        hello-world

Or edit the Kptfile directly:

    apiVersion: kpt.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Kptfile
    dependencies:
    - name: hello-world
      git:
        repo: "https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt.git"
        directory: "/package-examples/hello-world"
        ref: "master"

Dependencies have following schema:

    name: <local path (relative to the Kptfile) to fetch the dependency to>
    git:
      repo: <git repository>
      directory: <sub-directory under the git repository>
      ref: <git reference -- e.g. tag, branch, commit, etc>
    updateStrategy: <strategy to use when updating the dependency -- see kpt help update for more details>
    ensureNotExists: <remove the dependency, mutually exclusive with git>

Dependencies maybe be updated by updating their ` + "`" + `git.ref` + "`" + ` field and running ` + "`" + `kpt sync` + "`" + `
against the directory.
`
var SyncExamples = `
  Example Kptfile to sync:

    # file: my-package-dir/Kptfile

    apiVersion: kpt.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Kptfile
    # list of dependencies to sync
    dependencies:
    - name: local/destination/dir
      git:
        # repo is the git respository
        repo: "https://github.com/pwittrock/examples"
        # directory is the git subdirectory
        directory: "staging/cockroachdb"
        # ref is the ref to fetch
        ref: "v1.0.0"
    - name: local/destination/dir1
      git:
        repo: "https://github.com/pwittrock/examples"
        directory: "staging/javaee"
        ref: "v1.0.0"
      # set the strategy for applying package updates
      updateStrategy: "resource-merge"
    - name: app2
      path: local/destination/dir2
      # declaratively delete this dependency
      ensureNotExists: true

  Example invocation:

    # print the dependencies that would be modified
    kpt sync my-package-dir/ --dry-run

    # sync the dependencies
    kpt sync my-package-dir/`
