Kpt functions are conceptually similar to Kubernetes *controllers* and *validating webhooks* --
they are programs which read resources as input, then write resources as output (creating,
modifying, deleting, or validating resources).

Unlike controllers and validating webhooks, kpt functions can be run outside of the Kubernetes
control plane.  This allows them to run in more contexts or embedded in other systems.
For example, functions could be:

- manually run locally
- automatically run locally as part of *make*, *mvn*, *go generate*, etc
- automatically run in CICD systems
- run by controllers as reconcile implementations

{{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}
Unlikely pure-templating and DSL approaches, functions must be able to both *read* and *write*
resources, and specifically should be able to read resources they have previously written --
updating the inputs rather generating new resources.

This mirrors the level-triggered controller architecture used in the Kubernetes control plane.
A function reconciles the desired state of the resource configuration to match the declared state
specified by the functionConfig.

Functions that implement abstractions should update resources they have generated in the past
by reading them from the input.

The following function runtimes are available in kpt:

| Runtime    | Read Resources From | Write Resources To | Write Error Messages To | Validation Failure | Maturity |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Containers | STDIN               | STDOUT             | STDERR                  | Exit Code          | Beta     |
| Starlark   | ` + "`" + `ctx.resource_list` + "`" + ` | ` + "`" + `ctx.resource_list` + "`" + `| ` + "`" + `log` + "`" + `                   | Exit Code          | Alpha    |


## Input / Output

Functions read a ` + "`" + `ResourceList` + "`" + `, modify it, and write it back out.

### ResourceList.items

The ResourceList contains:
 
- (input+output) a list of resource ` + "`" + `items` + "`" + `
- (input) configuration for the function
- (output) validation results

Items are resources read from some source -- such as a package directory.

After a function adds, deletes or modifies items, the items will be written to a sink.
In most cases the sink will be the same as the source (directory).

  kind: ResourceList
  items:
  - apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    spec:
    ...
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    spec:
    ...

### ResourceList.functionConfig

Functions may optionally be configured using the ` + "`" + `ResourceList.functionConfig` + "`" + `
field.  ` + "`" + `functionConfig` + "`" + ` is analogous to a Deployment, and ` + "`" + `items` + "`" + ` 
is analogous to the set of all resources in the Deployment controller in-memory cache
(e.g. all the resources in the cluster) -- this includes the ReplicaSets created, updated
and deleted for that Deployment.

*Functions are responsible for identifying which resources from the ` + "`" + `items` + "`" + ` that they own.*

  kind: ResourceList
  functionConfig:
    apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Foo
    spec:
      foo: bar
      ...
  items:
    ...

{{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}
Some functions use a ConfigMap as the functionConfig instead of introducing a new resource type
bespoke to the function.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Running Functions

Functions may be run either imperatively using the form ` + "`" + `kpt fn run DIR/ --image fn` + "`" + `, or they
may be run declaratively using the form ` + "`" + `kpt fn run DIR/` + "`" + `.

Either way, ` + "`" + `kpt fn run` + "`" + ` will 

1. read the package directory as input
2. encapsulate the package resources in a ` + "`" + `ResourceList` + "`" + `
3. run the function(s), providing the ResourceList as input
4. write the function(s) output back to the package directory; creating, deleting, or updating
   resources

### Imperative Run

Functions can be run imperatively by specifying the ` + "`" + `--image` + "`" + ` flag.

` + "`" + `kpt fn run DIR/ --image some-image:version` + "`" + ` will:

- create a container from the image
- read all resources from the package directory
- provide the resources as input to the function (container)
- write the output items back to the package directory

  kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt-functions-sdk.git/example-configs example-configs
  mkdir results/
  kpt fn run example-configs/ --results-dir results/ --image gcr.io/kpt-functions/validate-rolebinding:results -- subject_name=bob@foo-corp.com

{{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}
If key-value pairs are provided after a ` + "`" + `--` + "`" + ` argument, then a ConfigMap will be generated
with these values as ` + "`" + `data` + "`" + ` elements, and the ConfigMap will be set as the functionConfig
field.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

### Declarative Run

Functions can be specified declaratively using the ` + "`" + `config.kubernetes.io/function` + "`" + `
annotation on a resource serving as the functionConfig.

` + "`" + `kpt fn run DIR/` + "`" + ` (without ` + "`" + `--image` + "`" + `) will:
 
- read all resources from the package directory
- for each resource with this annotation, kpt will run the specified function (using the resource as
  the functionConfig)
  - functions are run sequentially, with the output of each function provided as input
    to the next
- write the output items back to the package directory

{{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}
If multiple functions are specified in the same yaml file (e.g. separated by ` + "`" + `---` + "`" + `),
then they are run in the order they are specified.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Declaring Functions

Functions may be run by declaratively through the ` + "`" + `config.kubernetes.io/function` + "`" + ` annotation.

The following is a declaration to run the function implemented by the
` + "`" + `gcr.io/example.com/image:v1.0.0` + "`" + ` image, and to provide this ExampleFunction as the functionConfig.

  apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ExampleFunction
  metadata:
    annotations:
      config.kubernetes.io/function: |
        container:
          image: gcr.io/example.com/image:v1.0.0

## Function Scoping

Functions are scoped to resources that live in their same directory, or subdirectories of their
directory.

` + "`" + `kpt fn run DIR/` + "`" + ` will recursively traverse DIR/ looking for declared functions and invoking
them -- passing in only those resources scoped to the function.

## Validation

### ResourceList.results

Functions may define validation results through the ` + "`" + `results` + "`" + ` field.
When functions are run using the ` + "`" + `--results-dir` + "`" + `, each function's results field will be written
to a file under the specified directory.

  kind: ResourceList
  functionConfig:
    apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Foo
    spec:
      foo: bar
      ...
  results:
  - name: "kubeval"
    items:  
    - severity: error # one of ["error", "warn", "info"] -- error code should be non-0 if there are 1 or more errors
      tags: # arbitrary metadata about the result
        error-type: "field"
      message: "Value exceeds the namespace quota, reduce the value to make the pod schedulable"
      resourceRef: # key to lookup the resource
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        name: foo
        namespace: bar
      file:
        # optional if present as annotation
        path: deploy.yaml # read from annotation if present
        # optional if present as annotation
        index: 0 # read from annotation if present
      field:
        path: "spec.template.spec.containers[3].resources.limits.cpu"
        currentValue: "200" # number | string | boolean
        suggestedValue: "2" # number | string | boolean
    - severity: warn
      ...
  - name: "something else"
    items:
    - severity: info
       ...

## Deferring Failure

When running multiple validation functions, it may be desired to defer failures until all functions
have been run so that the results of all functions are written to the results directory.
Functions can specify that failures should be deferred by specifying ` + "`" + `deferFailure` + "`" + ` in the
declaration.

  apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ExampleFunction
  metadata:
    annotations:
      config.kubernetes.io/function: |
        container:
          image: gcr.io/example.com/image:v1.0.0
        deferFailure: true # continue running functions if this fails, and fail at the end

## FunctionConfig for imperative runs

When functions are run imperatively, the functionConfig may be generated from commandline arguments.

When functions are run using the form ` + "`" + `kpt fn run DIR/ --image foo:v1 -- a=b c=d` + "`" + `, the arguments
following ` + "`" + `--` + "`" + ` are parsed into a ConfigMap which is set as the functionConfig.

  kind: ResourceList
  functionConfig:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    spec:
      a: b
      ...
  items:
    ...

If the first argument after ` + "`" + `--` + "`" + ` is *not* a key=value pair, it will be used as the
functionConfig type.

` + "`" + `kpt fn run DIR/ --image foo:v1 -- Foo a=b c=d` + "`" + `

  kind: ResourceList
  functionConfig:
    kind: Foo
    spec:
      a: b
      ...
  items:
    ...`
