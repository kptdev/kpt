## TypeScript Function SDK

We provide an opinionated Typescript SDK for implementing config functions. This provides various
advantages:

- **General-purpose language:** Domain-Specific Languages begin their life with a reasonable
  feature set, but often grow over time. They bloat in order to accommodate the tremendous variety
  of customer use cases. Rather than follow this same course, config functions employ a true,
  general-purpose programming language that provides:
  - Proper abstractions and language features
  - A extensive ecosystem of tooling (e.g. IDE support)
  - A comprehensive catalog of well-supported libraries
  - Robust community support and detailed documentation
- **Type-safety:** Kubernetes configuration is typed, and its schema is defined using the OpenAPI spec.
  Typescript has a sophisticated type system that accommodates the complexity of Kubernetes resources.
  The SDK enables generating Typescript classes for core and CRD types, providing safe and easy
  interaction with Kubernetes objects.
- **Batteries-included:** The SDK provides a simple, powerful API for querying and manipulating configuration
  files. It provides the scaffolding required to develop, build, test, and publish functions,
  allowing you to focus on implementing your business-logic.
