var InitGuide = `
A kpt package is published as a git subdirectory containing configuration
files (YAML). Publishes of kpt packages can create or generate YAML files
however they like using the tool of their choice.

Publishing a package is done by pushing the git directory
(and optionally tagging it with a version).

{{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}
Multiple packages may exist in a single repo under separate subdirectories.

Packages may be nested -- both parent (composite) and child
(component) directories may be fetched as a kpt package.

A package is versioned by tagging the git repo as one of:

- ` + "`" + `package-subdirectory/package-version` + "`" + ` (directory scoped versioning)
- ` + "`" + `package-version` + "`" + ` (repo scoped versioning)

## Steps

1. [Create a git repo](#create-a-git-repo)
2. [Create the package contents](#create-the-package)
2. [Create configuration](#create-configuration)
3. [Publish package to git](#publish-package-to-git)

## Create a git repo

  git clone REPO_URL # or create a new repo with ` + "`" + `git init` + "`" + `
  cd REPO_NAME

## Create the package

  mkdir nginx

Recommended: initialize the package with metadata

  kpt pkg init nginx --tag kpt.dev/app=nginx --description "kpt nginx package"

## Create configuration

  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/master/content/en/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml --output nginx/nginx-deployment.yaml

## Publish package to git

  git add .
  git commit -m "Add nginx package"

Recommended: tag the commit as a release

  # tag as DIR/VERSION for per-directory versioning
  git tag nginx/v0.1.0
  git push nginx/v0.1.0`
