var ExecGuide = `
Functions may alternatively be run as executables outside of containers.  Exec
functions read input and write output the same as container functions, but are
run outside of a container.

Running functions as executables can be useful for function development, or for
running trusted executables.

Exec functions are disabled by default, and must be enabled with ` + "`" + `--enable-exec` + "`" + `.

{{% pageinfo color="info" %}}
Exec functions may be converted to container functions by building the executable
into a container and invoking it as the container ` + "`" + `CMD` + "`" + `.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Imperative Run

Exec functions may be run imperatively using the ` + "`" + `--exec-path` + "`" + ` flag with ` + "`" + `kpt fn run` + "`" + `.

  kpt fn run DIR/ --enable-exec --exec-path /path/to/executable

This is similar to building ` + "`" + `/path/to/executable` + "`" + ` into the container image
` + "`" + `gcr.io/project/image:tag` + "`" + ` and running -- except that the executable has access
to the local machine.

  kpt fn run DIR/ --image gcr.io/project/image:tag

Just like container functions, exec functions accept input as arguments after ` + "`" + `--` + "`" + `

  kpt fn run DIR/ --enable-exec --exec-path /path/to/executable -- foo=bar

## Declarative Run

Exec functions may also be run by declaring the function in a resource using the
` + "`" + `config.kubernetes.io/function` + "`" + ` annotation.

To run the declared function use ` + "`" + `kpt fn run DIR/ --enable-exec` + "`" + ` on the directory containing
the example.

  apiVersion: example.com/v1beta1
  kind: ExampleKind
  metadata:
    name: function-input
    annotations:
      config.kubernetes.io/function: |
        exec:
          path: /path/to/executable

Note: if the ` + "`" + `--enable-exec` + "`" + ` flag is not provided, ` + "`" + `kpt fn run DIR/` + "`" + ` will ignore the exec
function and exit 0.
