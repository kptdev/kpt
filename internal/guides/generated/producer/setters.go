var SettersGuide = `Setters provide a solution for template-free setting or substitution of field
values through package metadata (OpenAPI).  They are a safer alternative to
other substitution techniques which do not have the context of the
structured data -- e.g. using ` + "`" + `sed` + "`" + ` to replace values.

The OpenAPI definitions for setters are defined in a Kptfile and referenced by
a fields through comments on the fields.

Setters may be invoked to programmatically modify the configuration
using ` + "`" + `kpt cfg set` + "`" + ` to set and/or substitute values.

Creating a setter requires that the package has a Kptfile.  If one does
not exist for the package, run ` + "`" + `kpt pkg init DIR/` + "`" + ` to create one.

## Setters explained

Following is a short explanation of the command that will be demonstrated
in this guide.

### Data model

- Fields reference setters through OpenAPI definitions specified as
  line comments -- e.g. ` + "`" + `# { "$ref": "#/definitions/..." }` + "`" + `
- OpenAPI definitions are provided through the Kptfile

### Command control flow

1. Read the package Kptfile and resources.
2. Change the setter OpenAPI value in the Kptfile
3. Locate all fields which reference the setter and change their values.
4. Write both the modified Kptfile and resources back to the package.

#### Creating a Setter

Setters may be created either manually (by editing the Kptfile directly), or
programmatically (through the ` + "`" + `create-setter` + "`" + ` command).  The ` + "`" + `create-setter` + "`" + `
command will:

1. create a new OpenAPI definition for a setter in the Kptfile
2. create references to the setter definition on the resource fields

  # Kptfile -- original
  openAPI:
    definitions: {}

  # deployment.yaml -- original
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: foo
  spec:
    replicas: 3

  # create or update a setter named "replicas"
  # match fields with the value "3"
  kpt cfg create-setter hello-world/ replicas 3

  # Kptfile -- updated
  openAPI:
    definitions:
      io.k8s.cli.setters.replicas:
        x-k8s-cli:
          setter:
            name: "replicas"
            value: "3"

  # deployment.yaml -- updated
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: foo
  spec:
    replicas: 3 # {"$ref":"#/definitions/io.k8s.cli.setters.replicas"}

#### Invoking a Setter

  # deployment.yaml -- original
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
   name: helloworld-gke
   labels:
     app: hello
  spec:
   replicas: 3 # {"$ref":"#/definitions/io.k8s.cli.setters.replicas"}

  # set the replicas field to 5
  kpt cfg set DIR/ replicas 5

  # deployment.yaml -- updated
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
   name: helloworld-gke
   labels:
     app: hello
  spec:
   replicas: 5 # {"$ref":"#/definitions/io.k8s.cli.setters.replicas"}

#### Types

Setters may have types specified which ensure that the configuration is always
serialized correctly as yaml 1.1 -- e.g. if a string field such as an
annotation or arg has the value "on", then it would need to be quoted otherwise
it will be parsed as a bool by yaml 1.1.

This may be done by modifying the Kptfile OpenAPI definitions as shown here:

  openAPI:
    definitions:
      io.k8s.cli.setters.version:
        x-k8s-cli:
          setter:
            name: "version"
            value: "3"
        type: string

Set would change the configuration like this:

  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: foo
    annotations:
      version: "3" # {"$ref":"#/definitions/io.k8s.cli.setters.version"}

#### Enumerations

Setters may be configured to map an enum input to a different value set
in the configuration.

e.g. users set ` + "`" + `small` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `medium` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `large` + "`" + ` cpu sizes, and these are mapped
to numeric values set in the configuration.

This may be done by modifying the Kptfile OpenAPI definitions as shown here:

  openAPI:
    definitions:
      io.k8s.cli.setters.cpu:
        x-k8s-cli:
          setter:
            name: "cpu"
            value: "small"
            # enumValues will replace the user provided key with the
            # map value when setting fields.
            enumValues:
              small: "0.5"
              medium: "2"
              large: "4"

Set would change the configuration like this:

  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: foo
  spec:
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: foo
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5" # {"$ref":"#/definitions/io.k8s.cli.setters.cpu"}`
