var OamGuide = `
This guidance will demonstrate how to use kpt to manage custom Kubernetes applications (i.e. apps defined by CRDs instead of raw Kubernetes workloads).

We will use [Open Application Model](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec)(OAM) to describe the app for standardization and portability consideration. But you are free to use any Custom Resource to describe your application as well. [Crossplane](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane) will be installed as the OAM runtime for Kubernetes.

## What is kpt and what is OAM

Both kpt and OAM are outcomes of "Configuration-as-Data (or, Infrastructure-as-Data, IaD)".

Pioneered by [Kubernetes community](https://twitter.com/bgrant0607/status/1221485437153243137), Configuration-as-Data emphasizes that "configuration should be treated as data and leverage pipelines for manipulation and policy enforcement". In Kubernetes, Configuration-as-Data approach builds upon the design of the [Kubernetes resource model (KRM)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/resource-management.md). As a result, today any resource we applied to Kubernetes is a piece of data that represents the desired state for certain part of application or infrastructure in the real system.

With the heart of Configuration-as-Data, a typical Kubernetes native application management workflow just looks like a "pipeline". See the picture below:

![img](./resource/kpt_oam.png)

In this workflow, kpt is the manipulator of data. Stored in data source like Git, the original data (e.g. deployment.yaml) will pass through a pipeline of kpt functionalities to be manipulated into the desire state step by step. For example, ` + "`" + `labels` + "`" + ` added, ` + "`" + `replicas` + "`" + ` modified and ` + "`" + `image` + "`" + ` updated etc.

So what is OAM then? OAM is the format of data. More accurately, OAM is a specific data format so Kubernetes can expose higher level abstraction such as "application" to developers.

In that sense, it's a natural match for using kpt to manipulate the data which is formatted by OAM specification.

## Pre-requisites

Install OAM Kubernetes runtime (Crossplane) by following [its installation guides](https://github.com/oam-dev/crossplane-oam-sample#installation).

## Create App Repository for kpt

kpt directly use GitHub repo as App Repository, so no action needed.

With the help of kpt, we could directly use GitHub Repo as App Repository without organizing apps in any fixed format.

### Release your application to App Repository

So release your OAM app only needs two steps.

1. Create/Fork a github repo.

2. Commit and push your app.

    ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `` + "`" + `shell
    git add sampleapp/
    git commit -m "my sampleapp commit"
    git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-account>/<your-app-repo>.git
    git push -u origin master
    ` + "`" + `` + "`" + `` + "`" + `

### Fetch OAM app from remote Repository

Using our [example repository](https://github.com/oam-dev/samples/tree/master/5.OAM_KPT_Demo/repository/) for this demo.

You could fetch OAM app from remote Repository using [kpt pkg get](/reference/pkg/get/).

#### Command

  kpt pkg get https://github.com/oam-dev/samples.git/5.OAM_KPT_Demo/repository/sampleapp sampleapp

#### Output

  fetching package /5.OAM_KPT_Demo/repository/sampleapp from https://github.com/oam-dev/samples to sampleapp

  ➜  kpt tree sampleapp
  sampleapp
  ├── Kptfile
  ├── appconfig.yaml
  └── component.yaml
  
  0 directories, 3 files

### Install sample app

  $ kubectl apply -f sampleapp/
  component.core.oam.dev/example-component created
  applicationconfiguration.core.oam.dev/example-appconfig created

Several resources are created:

* Component is the description of what you want to deploy.
* ApplicationConfiguration is the description of operational policies for your Component.

Check the underlying Deployment instance generated by OAM.

  $ kubectl get deploy
  NAME                                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  example-appconfig-workload-deployment   3/3     3            3           114s

### Sync with Remote App Repository

When some changes occurred both local and remote apps, you could sync and merge with kpt.

Because kpt packages must be checked into a git repo before they are updated, if your app is not in the control of git,
you could init like below:

  git init
  git add sampleapp
  git commit -m "init"

Then our local sampleapp can be changed and sync with the remote app. For example, assume our remote sampleapp has changed and tagged as ` + "`" + `v0.1.0` + "`" + `.

  kpt pkg update sampleapp@v0.1.0 --strategy=resource-merge

Ref to [update section](/guides/consumer/update/#commit-local-changes) of kpt for more details.

### Live apply

kpt includes the next-generation **apply** commands developed out of the Kubernetes [cli-utils](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils) repository as the [` + "`" + `kpt live apply` + "`" + `](/reference/live/apply/) command.

This means with ` + "`" + `kpt live apply` + "`" + ` command, we could wait for the controller reconcile.

  $ kpt live init sampleapp
  Initialized: ../sampleapp/grouping-object-template.yaml

  $ kpt live apply sampleapp --reconcile-timeout=10m
  configmap/inventory-9ac03a44 unchanged
  applicationconfiguration.core.oam.dev/example-appconfig created
  component.core.oam.dev/example-component created
  3 resource(s) applied. 2 created, 1 unchanged, 0 configured
  configmap/inventory-9ac03a44 is Current: Resource is always ready
  applicationconfiguration.core.oam.dev/example-appconfig is NotFound: Resource not found
  component.core.oam.dev/example-component is NotFound: Resource not found
  applicationconfiguration.core.oam.dev/example-appconfig is Current: Resource is current
  component.core.oam.dev/example-component is Current: Resource is current
  all resources has reached the Current status
  0 resource(s) pruned

Happy building OAM apps with kpt!`
