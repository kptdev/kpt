var GithubActionsGuide = `
In this tutorial, you will pull an example blueprint that declares Kubernetes resources and two kpt functions. Then you will export a workflow that runs the functions against the resources on [GitHub Actions] and modify it manually to make it fully functional. This tutorial takes about 10 minutes.

{{% pageinfo color="info" %}}
A kpt version ` + "`" + `v0.32.0` + "`" + ` or higher is required.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Before you begin

*New to GitHub Actions? Here is [How to Configure a Workflow]*.

Before diving into the following tutorial, you need to create a public repo on GitHub if you don't have one yet, e.g. ` + "`" + `function-export-example` + "`" + `.

On your local machine, create an empty directory:

  mkdir function-export-example
  cd function-export-example

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
All commands must be run at the root of this directory.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Use ` + "`" + `kpt pkg get` + "`" + ` to fetch source files of this tutorial:

  # Init git
  git init
  git remote add origin https://github.com/<USER>/<REPO>.git
  # Fetch source files
  kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/package-examples/function-export-blueprint example-package

Then you will get an ` + "`" + `example-package` + "`" + ` directory:

- ` + "`" + `resources/resources.yaml` + "`" + `: declares a ` + "`" + `Deployment` + "`" + ` and a ` + "`" + `Namespace` + "`" + `.
- ` + "`" + `resources/constraints/` + "`" + `: declares constraints used by the ` + "`" + `gatekeeper-validate` + "`" + ` function.
- ` + "`" + `functions.yaml` + "`" + `: runs two functions from [Kpt Functions Catalog] declaratively:
  - ` + "`" + `gatekeeper-validate` + "`" + ` enforces constraints over all resources.
  - ` + "`" + `label-namespace` + "`" + ` adds a label to all Namespaces.

## Exporting a workflow

  kpt fn export example-package --workflow github-actions --output main.yaml

Running the command above will produce a ` + "`" + `main.yaml` + "`" + ` file that looks like this:

  name: kpt
  on:
      push:
          branches:
            - master
  jobs:
      Kpt:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Run all kpt functions
              uses: docker://gcr.io/kpt-dev/kpt:latest
              with:
                  args: fn run example-package

## Integrating with your existing pipeline

Now you can manually copy and paste the content of the ` + "`" + `main.yaml` + "`" + ` file into your existing GitHub Actions workflow.

If you do not have one, you can follow these steps:

1. Copy the content of the exported ` + "`" + `main.yaml` + "`" + ` file into ` + "`" + `.github/workflows/main.yaml` + "`" + ` in your project root. 
1. To make it fully functional, you may add a ` + "`" + `checkout` + "`" + ` step before the ` + "`" + `Run all kpt functions` + "`" + ` step to pull source files from your repo.
1. If you want to see the diff after running kpt functions, append a ` + "`" + `Show diff` + "`" + ` step.

Your final workflow may looks like this:

  name: kpt
  on:
      push:
          branches:
            - master
  jobs:
      Kpt:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  
            - name: Run all kpt functions
              uses: docker://gcr.io/kpt-dev/kpt:latest
              with:
                  args: fn run example-package
            
            - name: Show diff
              uses: docker://alpine/git
              with:
                  args: diff 

## Viewing the result on GitHub Actions

  git add .
  git commit -am 'Init pipeline'
  git push --set-upstream origin master

Once the changes are committed and pushed, you can see the latest job on GitHub Actions like this:

{{< png src="images/fn-export/github-actions-result" >}}

## Next step

Try to remove the ` + "`" + `owner: alice` + "`" + ` line in ` + "`" + `example-package/resources/resources.yaml` + "`" + `.

Once local changes are pushed, you can see how the pipeline fails on GitHub Actions.
