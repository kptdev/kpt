## Topics

[kpt pkg get], [Kptfile]

## ` + "`" + `kpt pkg get` + "`" + ` explained

Following is a short explanation of the command that will be demonstrated
in this guide.

- Get copies the ` + "`" + `staging/cockroachdb` + "`" + ` subdirectory from the
  [kubernetes examples] git repo
  - Since a [Kptfile] is not included with the package, a new one is created
    for the local package
- (Optional) commit the package and push to the team git repo
- Apply the package to a cluster
  - May be pushed from the local package copy (manual) or from the team repo
    (GitOps automation)

## Steps

1. [Fetch a remote package](#fetch-a-remote-package)
2. [View the Kptfile](#view-the-kptfile)
3. [View the package contents](#view-the-package-contents)
4. [Apply the package to a cluster](#apply-the-package-to-a-cluster)
5. [View the applied package](#view-the-applied-package)

## Fetch a remote package

Packages are **fetched from remote git repository subdirectories** using
[kpt pkg get].  This guide will use the [kubernetes examples] repository
as a public package catalogue.

### Fetch Command

  kpt pkg get https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/staging/cockroachdb cockroachdb

### Fetch Output

  fetching package staging/cockroachdb from https://github.com/kubernetes/examples to cockroachdb

The contents of the ` + "`" + `staging/cockroachdb` + "`" + ` subdirectory in the
` + "`" + `https://github.com/kubernetes/examples` + "`" + ` were copied to the local folder
` + "`" + `cockroachdb` + "`" + `.

{{% pageinfo color="info" %}}

- Any git subdirectory containing configuration (e.g. ` + "`" + `deploy.yaml` + "`" + `) may be
  fetched and used as a package
- The local directory name that the package is copied to does NOT need to
  match the upstream directory name it is copied from
- including ` + "`" + `.git` + "`" + ` as part of the repo name is optional but good practice to
  ensure the repo + subdirectory are parsed correctly by the tool.
- Packages inside the same repo can be versioned individually by creating tags
  with the format ` + "`" + `<path to package in repo>/<version>` + "`" + `, similar to how go
  modules are versioned. For example, a tag named ` + "`" + `staging/cockroachdb/v1.2.3` + "`" + `
  would be interpreted by kpt as version ` + "`" + `v1.2.3` + "`" + ` of the cockroachdb package.

## View the Kptfile

### Kptfile Command

The upstream commit and branch / tag reference are stored in the package's
[Kptfile].  These are used by ` + "`" + `kpt pkg update` + "`" + `.

  cat cockroachdb/Kptfile

Print the ` + "`" + `Kptfile` + "`" + ` written by ` + "`" + `kpt pkg get` + "`" + ` to see the upstream package data.

### Kptfile Output

  apiVersion: kpt.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: Kptfile
  metadata:
      name: cockroachdb
  upstream:
      type: git
      git:
          commit: 629c9459a9f25e468cce8af28350a03e62c5f67d
          repo: https://github.com/kubernetes/examples
          directory: staging/cockroachdb
          ref: master

## View the package contents

The primary package artifacts are Kubernetes [resource configuration]
(e.g. YAML files), however packages may also include supporting
artifacts such as documentation.

### Package Contents Command

  tree cockroachdb/

### Package Contents Output

  cockroachdb/
  ├── Kptfile
  ├── OWNERS
  ├── README.md
  ├── cockroachdb-statefulset.yaml
  ├── demo.sh
  └── minikube.sh
  
  0 directories, 6 files

The cockroachdb package fetched from [kubernetes examples] contains a
` + "`" + `cockroachdb-statefulset.yaml` + "`" + ` file with the resource configuration, as well
as other files included in the directory.

{{% pageinfo color="info" %}}
` + "`" + `kpt pkg get` + "`" + ` created a ` + "`" + `Kptfile` + "`" + ` since one did not exist
(for storing package state).  If the upstream package already defines a
` + "`" + `Kptfile` + "`" + `, then ` + "`" + `kpt pkg get` + "`" + ` will update the ` + "`" + `Kptfile` + "`" + ` copied from
upstream rather than replacing it.

### Command

  head cockroachdb/cockroachdb-statefulset.yaml

### Output

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    # This service is meant to be used by clients of the database. It exposes a
    # ClusterIP that will automatically load balance connections to the different
    # database pods.
    name: cockroachdb-public
    labels:
      app: cockroachdb
  spec:
    ports:

This package contains ` + "`" + `cockroachdb/cockroachdb-statefulset.yaml` + "`" + ` as plain old
resource configuration (e.g. YAML) -- nothing special here.  Other kpt packages
may have configuration which uses comments to attach metadata to
specific resources or fields.

## Apply the package to a cluster

Use ` + "`" + `kubectl apply` + "`" + ` to deploy the local package to a remote cluster.

### Apply Command

  kubectl apply -R -f cockroachdb

### Apply Output

  service/cockroachdb-public created
  service/cockroachdb created
  poddisruptionbudget.policy/cockroachdb-budget unchanged
  statefulset.apps/cockroachdb created

{{% pageinfo color="info" %}}
This guide used ` + "`" + `kubectl apply` + "`" + ` to demonstrate how kpt packages work out of the
box with tools that have been around since the beginning of Kubernetes.

Kpt also provides the next-generation set of Kubernetes apply commands under
the [kpt live] command.

## View the applied package

Once applied to the cluster, the remote resources can be displayed using
the common tools such as ` + "`" + `kubectl get` + "`" + `.

### Applied Package Command

  kubectl get all
