[kpt live apply]

Because kpt packages are composed of resource configuration can be applied with
` + "`" + `kubectl apply -R -f DIR` + "`" + `, however kpt includes the next-generation **apply**
commands developed out of the Kubernetes [cli-utils] repository as the
[kpt live apply] command.

Kpt live apply provides additional functionality beyond what is provided by
` + "`" + `kubectl apply` + "`" + `, such as communicating back resource status and pruning
resources for deleted configuration.

## Fetch a remote package

### Command

  export SRC_REPO=https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt.git
  kpt pkg get $SRC_REPO/package-examples/helloworld-set@v0.5.0 helloworld

Grab a remote package to apply to a cluster.

### Output

  fetching package /package-examples/helloworld-set from https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt to helloworld

## Initialize the package inventory template

The kpt version of apply uses a ConfigMap map to keep track of previously
applied resources so they can be pruned later if the configuration for
them is deleted. The [kpt live init] command will generate an inventory template
(which is just a normal ConfigMap manifest with a special annotation) used by
[kpt live apply] to generate an actual ConfigMap in the cluster which we refer
to as an inventory object.

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
The inventory template must be created for a package to be applied using
` + "`" + `kpt live apply` + "`" + `.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

### Init Command

  kpt live init helloworld

### Init Output

  Initialized: helloworld/inventory-template.yaml

### Inventory template

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
  ...
    name: inventory
    labels:
      # DANGER: Do not change the value of this label.
      # Changing this value will cause a loss of continuity
      # with previously applied inventory objects. Set deletion
      # and pruning functionality will be impaired.
      cli-utils.sigs.k8s.io/inventory-id: 060da2f6-dc0e-4425-a286-9a4acbad063d

A ConfigMap with the ` + "`" + `cli-utils.sigs.k8s.io/inventory-id` + "`" + ` label has been
created, and will be used by apply to generate a history of previously
applied resources.  This file should be checked into ` + "`" + `git` + "`" + ` along with the
rest of the package, but otherwise ignored by users.

## Apply to a cluster

### Apply Command

  kpt live apply helloworld --reconcile-timeout=2m

Apply the resources to the cluster and block until the changes have
been fully rolled out -- e.g. until the Pods are running.

### Apply Output

  configmap/inventory-17c4dd3c created
  service/helloworld-gke created
  deployment.apps/helloworld-gke created
  3 resource(s) applied. 3 created, 0 unchanged, 0 configured
  configmap/inventory-2911da3b is Current: Resource is always ready
  service/helloworld-gke is Current: Service is ready
  deployment.apps/helloworld-gke is InProgress: Available: 0/5
  deployment.apps/helloworld-gke is InProgress: Available: 2/5
  deployment.apps/helloworld-gke is Current: Deployment is available. Replicas: 5
  resources failed to the reached Current status
  0 resource(s) pruned

Apply prints the status of the resources as it waits for all changes to
be rolled out.

## Print the live resources

Display the resources in the cluster using kubectl.

### Print Command

  kubectl get configmaps,deploy,services

### Print Output

  NAME                                 DATA   AGE
  configmap/inventory-28c4kc3c         2      2m47s
  
  NAME                             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  deployment.apps/helloworld-gke   5/5     5            5           2m47s
  
  NAME                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
  service/helloworld-gke   NodePort    10.48.2.143   <none>        80:32442/TCP   2m47s
  service/kubernetes       ClusterIP   10.48.0.1     <none>        443/TCP        19m

### Command: ` + "`" + `tree` + "`" + `

  kubectl get all -o yaml | kpt cfg tree

The output of kubectl can also be piped to [kpt cfg tree] to summarize
the resources.

### Output: ` + "`" + `tree` + "`" + `

## Prune resources

Resources can be deleted from the cluster by deleting them from the
resource configuration.sh

### Prune Command

  rm helloworld/deploy.yaml
  kpt live apply helloworld/ --reconcile-timeout=2m

Apply uses the previously created inventory objects (ConfigMaps) to calculate
the set of resources to prune (delete) after applying.  In this case the
Deployment.

### Prune Output

  service/helloworld-gke is Current: Service is ready
  resources failed to the reached Current status
  deployment.apps/helloworld-gke pruned
  configmap/inventory-2911da3b pruned
  2 resource(s) pruned

### Print the live resources after pruning

  kubectl get deploy

  No resources found in default namespace.
