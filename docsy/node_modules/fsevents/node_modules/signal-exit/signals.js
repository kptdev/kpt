// This is not the set of all possible signals.
//
// It IS, however, the set of all signals that trigger
// an exit on either Linux or BSD systems.  Linux is a
// superset of the signal names supported on BSD, and
// the unknown signals just fail to register, so we can
// catch that easily enough.
//
// Don't bother with SIGKILL.  It's uncatchable, which
// means that we can't fire any callbacks anyway.
//
// If a user does happen to register a handler on a non-
// fatal signal like SIGWINCH or something, and then
// exit, it'll end up firing `process.emit('exit')`, so
// the handler will be fired anyway.
//
// SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV and SIGILL, when not raised
// artificially, inherently leave the process in a
// state from which it is not safe to try and enter JS
// listeners.
