In this chapter, we are going to cover _package orchestration_ - management
of package lifecycle supported by the kpt toolchain and Porch - Package
Orchestration service.

Package Orchestration encompasses management of the overall lifecycle of
configuration [**packages**](/book/02-concepts/01-packages), including:

* management of package repositories
* discovery of configuration packages and kpt
  [**functions**](/book/02-concepts/03-functions)
* creating, modifying, updating, and deleting packages
* versioning packages
* WYSIWYG package authoring
* package customization with _guardrails_
* evaluation of functions on package contents
* approval flow to publish a change to a configuration package
* deployment and rollouts

Package Orchestration enables [workflows](/book/02-concepts/02-workflows)
similar to those supported by the kpt CLI, but makes them available as a
service. This enables creation of WYSIWYG user experiences, similar to the
proof-of-concept [Backstage plugin](/guides/namespace-provisioning-ui).

Dedicated user guides are available for the use of Porch with the
[Backstage UI](/guides/namespace-provisioning-ui) and
the [kpt cli](/guides/porch-user-guide). In the following sections
of the book you will follow the basic journey of discovering and authoring
configuration packages using Porch - the Package Orchestration service.
