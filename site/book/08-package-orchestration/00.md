In this chapter, we are going to cover _package orchestration_ - management
of package lifecycle supported by the kpt toolchain.

Package Orchestration encompasses management of the overall lifecycle of the
configuration package, including:

* management of package repositories
* discovery of configuration packages and kpt functions
* creating, modifying, updating, and deleting packages
* versioning packages
* WYSIWYG package authoring and customization with _guardrails_
* evaluation of functions on package data
* approval flow to publish a change to a configuration package
* deployment and rollouts

Package Orchestration enables [workflows](/book/02-concepts/02-workflows)
similar to those supported by the kpt CLI, but makes them available as a
service and enables creation of WYSIWYG user experiences, similar to the
proof-of-concept [Backstage plugin](/guides/namespace-provisioning-ui).

## Package Orchestration Concepts

Package Orchestration relies on the already familiar concepts of
[**Package**](/book/02-concepts/01-packages)
and [**Function**](/book/02-concepts/03-functions).

Package Orchestrator supports several **lifecycle stages** of packages:
* ***Draft*** - package is being created or edited. The package contents can be
  modified but package is not ready to be used (deployed or cloned)
* ***Proposed*** - author of the package proposed that the package be published
* ***Published*** - the changes to the package have been approved and the
  package is ready to be used. Published packages can be deployed or cloned.

A **Repository** containing kpt packages (for example a [git][] repository or
an [OCI][] container registry) can be registered with the Package Orchestrator
to enable package discovery or management.

An [OCI][] container registry containing kpt functions can be registered with
the Package Orchestrator to enable discovery of kpt functions.

A repository containing *packages* can be designated as a
***deployment repository***. *Published* packages in a deployment repository are
considered deployment-ready.

The following image illustrates how Package Orchestration fits into the overall
configuration management ecosystem. Package Orchestration service enables
management of packages in registered repositories and enables WYSIWYG UI
experience of package authoring.
A separate GitOps deployment mechanism (for example [Config Sync][]) is used to
deploy published packages to realize the live state from the configuration and
provides observability of the status of deployed resources.
