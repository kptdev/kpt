Kubernetes configuration packages and customizations go hand in hand, all the 
packaging tools enable package customization, since every package needs to be adapted to each specific use. In this chapter we cover effective 
customizations techniques that kpt rendering and packaging enables.  We show how
providing customization through parameters has some [pitfalls] and recommend
alternatives where the contents of the package are not hidden behind a facade.
Some of these alternatives are only possible because kpt has made an investment 
into bulk editing with [KRM functions] and upstream merging.
