Kubernetes configuration packages and customizations go hand in hand, all the 
packaging tools enable package customization. In this chapter we cover effective 
customizations techniques the kpt hydration and packaging enables.  We show how
providing customization through parameters has some pitfalls and recommend
alternatives where the contents of the package are no hidden behind a facade.
Some of these alternatives are only possible because kpt has made an investment 
into bulk editing with KRM functions and upstream merging.
