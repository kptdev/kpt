[Chapter 2] provided a high-level conceptual explanation of functions. We
discussed how this architecture enables us to develop functions in different
languages, frameworks and runtimes. In this chapter, we are going to look at
different approaches to developing functions.

?> Before you start developing your custom function, check out the
[Functions Catalog](https://catalog.kpt.dev/ ":target=_self") in case there is
an existing function that meets your needs. This is an ever-growing catalog of
functions that we consider to be generally useful to many users. If your use
case fits that description, please [open a feature request][fr] for adding a
function to the catalog.

## Approaches

### Creating Custom Images

With this approach you create a custom container image which can execute
programs in an arbitrary language or encapsulate existing tools as long as it
satisfies the KRM Functions Specification we will see later in this chapter.

To simplify development, we provide frameworks for developing functions in Go
and Typescript. We will cover these later in this chapter.

### Authoring Executable Configuration

Instead of developing a custom image, you can use an existing function image
containing a language interpreter, and provide your business logic in a KRM
resource. This is referred to as _executable configuration_. We will see two
examples of executable configuration pattern in this chapter.

Although using executable configuration saves some time initially, it can become
an anti-pattern if it grows in complexity. We recommend limiting their use to:

- Small amount of logic (< 20 lines)
- You do not forsee this logic growing in complexity in the future

Otherwise, you are better off developing functions in a general-purpose language
where you can take advantage of proper abstractions and language features,
better testing, rich IDE experience, and existing libraries.

## Function Properties

As you think about how to formulate your function, keep in mind the following
desired properties:

### Deterministic

Executing a function with the same input should produce the same output. For
example, a function that annotates a resource with the current timestamp is not
deterministic.

Note that input to the function includes both `input items` and the
`functionConfig`:

### Idempotent

Executing a function a second time should not produce any change. For example, a
function that increments value of the `replicas` field by 1 is not idempotent.
Instead, the function could take the desired value of the `replicas` field as
input.

This property enables in-place edits to work and is analogous to the
level-driven reconciliation model of the Kubernetes system.

### Hermetic and Unprivileged

If possible, try to formulate your function to be hermetic. We discussed this in
detail in [chapter 4].
