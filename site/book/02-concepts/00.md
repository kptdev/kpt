What is kpt?

> kpt is a Git-native, schema-aware, extensible client-side tool for packaging, customizing,
> validating, and applying Kubernetes resources.

That's a pretty terse description, so let's break it down:

- **Git-native**: kpt uses Git to share, consume, and update configuration. As a result,
  configuration changes may be reviewed, approved, audited and rolled back using existing Git
  workflows.

- **Schema-aware**: Configuration used by kpt must conform to the _Kubernetes Resource Model
  (KRM)_ which have a defined schema and semantics. KRM resources — whether core Kubernetes
  resources such as `Deployment` or custom resources defined using a `CRD` — have an OpenAPI
  specification which is used for schema-aware operations in kpt. For example, when rebasing a
  locally modified package to a new version, the merge operation is more than simply performing a
  text-based file merge, it takes the schema into account.

  In contrast, many configuration tools today interleave data and code, for example by embedding a
  templating language in YAML. As configuration becomes complex, it becomes hard to read and
  understand. Furthermore, this prevent external tooling from easily consuming such configuration
  leading to a closed ecosystem.

- **Extensible**: kpt provides a small core machinery and powerful extension mechanisms. There are
  two main extension mechanisms in kpt: a) kpt can gain semantic understanding of arbitrary KRM
  resources by consuming OpenAPI documents. kpt core itself does not hardcode any type-specific
  information. b) kpt can perform arbitrary operations on resources using kpt functions.

- **Packaging**: A package is a bundle of KRM resources representing a useful unit of functionality.

- **Customizing**: Off-the-shelf packages are rarely deployed without any customization. We know
  from experience working with Kubernetes configuration and with internal systems at Google that
  there is no one-size-fit-all customization technique. Sometimes the most appropriate customization
  is to edit a YAML file directly. Sometimes, you want to automate a one-time customization,
  sometimes you want to repeatedly perform a customization. Sometimes you want to use
  parameterization, sometimes perform bulk search & replace, sometimes you want to use a
  general-purpose programming language. kpt enables all these techniques. In contrast, tools that
  provide just one customization technique (e.g. parameterization) cannot address all these
  different use cases well and inevitably lead to anti-patterns (e.g. over-parameterization).

- **Validating**: In the era of fast-paced DevOps, we need to reduce the risk of misconfiguration
  leading to an outage, security vulnerabilities, or non-compliance. Validation goes hand-in-hand
  with customization and kpt functions can be used to automate both mutation and validation of
  resources. Example of validator functions include schema-validation, linting, policy enforcement,
  and security auditing.

- **Applying**: When it comes to deploying a package to a Kubernetes cluster, kpt complements
  `kubectl`. By keeping an inventory of deployed resources, kpt enables resource pruning, aggregated
  status and observability, and an improved preview experience.

The two fundamental concepts in kpt are packages and functions. Let's define them.
