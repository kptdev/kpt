A kpt function (also called a _KRM function_) is a containerized program that
can perform CRUD operations on KRM resources stored on the local filesystem. kpt
functions are the extensible mechanism to automate mutation and validation of
KRM resources. Some example use cases:

- Enforce all `Namespace` resources to have a `cost-center` label.
- Add a label to resources based on some filtering criteria
- Use a `Team` custom resource to generate a `Namespace` and associated
  organization-mandated defaults (e.g. `RBAC`, `ResourceQuota`, etc.) when
  bootstrapping a new team
- Bulk transformation of all `PodSecurityPolicy` resources to improve the
  security posture.
- Inject a sidecar container (service mesh, mysql proxy, logging) in a workload
  resource (e.g. `Deployment`)

Since functions are containerized, they can encapsulate different toolchains,
languages, and runtimes. For example, the function container image can
encapsulate:

- A binary built using kpt's official Go or Typescript SDK
- Wrap an existing KRM tool such as `kubeval`
- Invoke a bash script performing low-level operations
- The interpreter for "executable configuration" such as `Starlark` or `Rego`

To astute readers, this model will sound familiar: functions are the client-side
analog to Kubernetes controllers:

|                  | Client-side              | Server-side       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Orchestrator** | kpt                      | Kubernetes        |
| **Data**         | YAML files on filesystem | resources on etcd |
| **Programs**     | functions                | controllers       |

Just as Kubernetes system orchestrates server-side containers, kpt CLI
orchestrates client-side containers operating on configuration. By standardizing
the input and output of the function containers, and how the containers are
executed, kpt can provide the following guarantees:

- Functions are interoperable
- Functions can be chained together
- Functions are hermetic. For correctness, security and speed, it's desirable to
  be able to run functions hermetically without any privileges; preventing
  out-of-band access to the host filesystem and networking.

We will discuss the KRM Functions Specification Standard in detail in Chapter 5.
At a high level, a function execution looks like this:

where:

- `input items`: The input list of KRM resources to operate on.
- `output items`: The output list obtained from adding, removing, or modifying
  items in the input.
- `functionConfig`: An optional meta resource containing the arguments to this
  invocation of the function.
- `results`: An optional meta resource emitted by the function for observability
  and debugging purposes.

Naturally, functions can be chained together in a pipeline:

There are two different CLI commands that execute functions corresponding to two
fundamentally different approaches:

- `kpt fn render`: Executes the pipeline of functions declared in the package
  and its subpackages. This is a declarative way to run functions.
- `kpt fn eval`: Executes a given function on the package. The image to run and
  the `functionConfig` is specified as CLI argument. This is an imperative way
  to run functions. Since the function is provided explicitly by the user, an
  imperative invocation can be more privileged and low-level than an declarative
  invocation. For example, it can have access to the host system.

We will discuss how to run functions in Chapter 4 and how to develop functions
in Chapter 5.
