In this chapter of this book, we are going to cover how you deploy a kpt
package to a Kubernetes cluster and how the cluster state is managed as the
package evolves over time.

We use `kpt live apply` instead `kubectl apply` since it provides some critical
functionality not provided by the latter: pruning and reconcile status. To
enable this functionality, we need a cluster-side mechanism for grouping and
tracking resources belonging to a package. This cluster-side grouping is
implemented using a custom resource of kind `ResourceGroup`. Otherwise,
`kpt live` and `kubectl` are complementary. For example, you can use
`kubectl get` as you normal would.

## Pruning

`live apply` will automatically delete cluster resources that are no longer
present in the local package. This clean-up functionality is called pruning.

For example, consider a package which has been applied with the following three
resources:

```
service-1 (Service)
deployment-1 (Deployment)
config-map-1 (ConfigMap)
```

Then imagine the package is updated to contain the following resources:

```
service-1 (Service)
deployment-1 (Deployment)
config-map-2 (ConfigMap)
```

When the updated package is applied, `config-map-1` is automatically deleted
from the cluster.

## Reconcile Status

Kubernetes is based on an asynchronous reconciliation model. When you apply a
resource to a cluster, you actually care about two different things:

- Did the resource apply successfully (synchronous)?
- Did the resource reconcile successfully (asynchronous)?

This is referred to as _apply status_ and _reconcile status_ respectively:

The `live apply` command computes the reconcile status. An example of this could
be applying a `Deployment`. Without computing reconcile status, the operation
would be reported as successful as soon as the resource has been created in the
API server. With reconcile status, `live apply` will wait until the desired
number of pods have been created and become available.

For core kubernetes types, reconcile status is computed using hardcoded rules.
For CRDs, the status computation is based on recommended [convention for status
fields] that needs to be followed by custom resource publishers. If CRDs follow
these conventions, `live apply` will be able to correctly compute status.

Once you know the reconcile status of a single resource, then you really want to
answer the following question:

- Did all the resources in the local package reconcile successfully?

This is referred to as _aggregated status_.

## Dependency ordering

Sometimes resources must be applied in a specific order. For example,
an application might require that a database is available when it starts.
`kpt live` lets users express these constraints on resources, and use them
to make sure a resource has been successfully applied and reconciled before
any resources that depend on it are applied.
