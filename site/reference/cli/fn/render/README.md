<!--mdtogo:Short
   Render a package.
-->

`render` executes the pipeline of functions on resources in the package and
writes the output to the local filesystem in-place.

`render` executes the pipelines in the package hierarchy in a depth-first order.
For example, if a package A contains subpackage B, then the pipeline in B is
executed on resources in B and then the pipeline in A is executed on resources
in A and the output of the pipeline from package B. The output of the pipeline
from A is then written to the local filesystem in-place.

`render` formats the resources before writing them to the local filesystem.

Meta resources (i.e. `Kptfile` and `functionConfig`) are excluded from the
inputs to the functions.

If any of the functions in the pipeline fails, then the entire pipeline is
aborted and the local filesystem is left intact.

Refer to the [Declarative Functions Execution] for more details.

### Synopsis

<!--mdtogo:Long-->

```
kpt fn render [PKG_PATH] [flags]
```

#### Args

```
PKG_PATH:
  Local package path to render. Directory must exist and contain a Kptfile
  to be updated. Defaults to the current working directory.
```

#### Flags

```
--image-pull-policy:
  If the image should be pulled before rendering the package(s). It can be set
  to one of always, ifNotPresent, never. If unspecified, always will be the
  default.

--output, o:
  If specified, the output resources are written to provided location,
  if not specified, resources are modified in-place.
  Allowed values: stdout|unwrap|<OUT_DIR_PATH>
  1. stdout: output resources are wrapped in ResourceList and written to stdout.
  2. unwrap: output resources are written to stdout, in multi-object yaml format.
  3. OUT_DIR_PATH: output resources are written to provided directory.
     The provided directory must not already exist.

--results-dir:
  Path to a directory to write structured results. Directory will be created if
  it doesn't exist. Structured results emitted by the functions are aggregated and saved
  to `results.yaml` file in the specified directory.
  If not specified, no result files are written to the local filesystem.
```

### Examples

<!--mdtogo:Examples-->

```shell
# Render the package in current directory
$ kpt fn render
```

```shell
# Render the package in current directory and save results in my-results-dir
$ kpt fn render --results-dir my-results-dir
```

```shell
# Render my-package-dir
$ kpt fn render my-package-dir
```

```shell
# Render the package in current directory and write output resources to another DIR
$ kpt fn render -o path/to/dir
```

```shell
# Render resources in current directory and write unwrapped resources to stdout
# which can be piped to kubectl apply
$ kpt fn render -o unwrap | kubectl apply -f -
```

```shell
# Render resources in current directory, write the wrapped resources
# to stdout which are piped to 'set-annotations' function,
# the transformed resources are written to another directory
$ kpt fn render -o stdout \
| kpt fn eval - -i gcr.io/kpt-fn/set-annotations:v0.1.3 -o path/to/dir  -- foo=bar
```
