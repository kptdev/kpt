    Managing custom Kubernetes applications with kpt
---

This guidance will demonstrate how to use kpt to manage custom Kubernetes applications (i.e. apps defined by CRDs instead of raw Kubernetes workloads).

We will use [Open Application Model](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec)(OAM) to describe the app for standardization and portability consideration. But you are free to use any Custom Resource to describe your application as well. [Crossplane](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane) will be installed as the OAM runtime for Kubernetes.

## What is kpt and what is OAM?

Both kpt and OAM are outcomes of "Configuration-as-Data (or, Infrastructure-as-Data, IaD)".

Pioneered by [Kubernetes community](https://twitter.com/bgrant0607/status/1221485437153243137), Configuration-as-Data emphasizes that "configuration should be treated as data and leverage pipelines for manipulation and policy enforcement". In Kubernetes, Configuration-as-Data approach builds upon the design of the [Kubernetes resource model (KRM)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/resource-management.md). As a result, today any resource we applied to Kubernetes is a piece of data that represents the desired state for certain part of application or infrastructure in the real system.

With the heart of Configuration-as-Data, a typical Kubernetes native application management workflow just looks like a "pipeline". See the picture below:

In this workflow, kpt is the manipulator of data. Stored in data source like Git, the original data (e.g. deployment.yaml) will pass through a pipeline of kpt functionalities to be manipulated into the desire state step by step. For example, `labels` added, `replicas` modified and `image` updated etc. 

So what is OAM then? OAM is the format of data. More accurately, OAM is a specific data format so Kubernetes can expose higher level abstraction such as "application" to developers.

In that sense, it's a natural match for using kpt to manipulate the data which is formatted by OAM specification.

## Pre-requisites

Install OAM Kubernetes runtime (Crossplane) by following [its installation guides](https://github.com/oam-dev/crossplane-oam-sample#installation).

## Create App Repository for kpt

kpt directly use GitHub repo as App Repository, so no action needed.

With the help of kpt, we could directly use GitHub Repo as App Repository without organizing apps in any fixed format.

### Release your application to App Repository

So release your OAM app only needs two steps.

1. Create/Fork a github repo.

2. Commit and push your app.
    ```shell
    git add sampleapp/
    git commit -m "my sampleapp commit"
    git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-account>/<your-app-repo>.git
    git push -u origin master
    ```

### Fetch OAM app from remote Repository

Using our [example repository](https://github.com/oam-dev/sample/tree/master/5.OAM_KPT_Demo/repository/) for this demo.

You could fetch OAM app from remote Repository using [kpt pkg get](https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/reference/pkg/get/).

#### Command

```shell
kpt pkg get https://github.com/oam-dev/samples.git/5.OAM_KPT_Demo/repository/sampleapp sampleapp
```

#### Output

```output
fetching package /5.OAM_KPT_Demo/repository/sampleapp from https://github.com/oam-dev/samples to sampleapp
```

```shell
➜  kpt tree sampleapp
sampleapp
├── Kptfile
├── appconfig.yaml
└── component.yaml

0 directories, 5 files
```

### Install sample app

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f sampleapp/
component.core.oam.dev/example-component created
applicationconfiguration.core.oam.dev/example-appconfig created
```

Several resources are created:

* Component is the description of what you want to deploy.
* ApplicationConfiguration is the description of operational policies for your Component.

Check the underlying Deployment instance generated by OAM.

```shell
$ kubectl get deploy
NAME                                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
example-appconfig-workload-deployment   3/3     3            3           114s
```


### Sync with Remote App Repository

When some changes occurred both local and remote apps, you could sync and merge with kpt.

For example, we changed our sampleapp and tag it as `v0.1.0`. Then our local sampleapp also be changed.

```shell
kpt pkg update sampleapp@v0.1.0 --strategy=resource-merge
```

Ref to [update section](https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/guides/consumer/update/#commit-local-changes) of kpt for more details.


### Parameter Setting

[kpt setters](https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/guides/consumer/set/) is a powerful feature which naturally matches to the idea of "separate concerns" design from OAM.

In Open Application Model, developers can claim certain fields in the application YAML as "configurable", so in the following workflow, operators (or the platform) will be allowed to modify these fields.

Now this workflow can be easily achieved with help of kpt.

#### Create setter by App Developer

Let's say the developer need to claim two fields as "configurable" for his application, he can add two kpt setters here:

```shell
$ kpt cfg create-setter sampleapp/ instance-name example-component --field "metadata.name" --description "use to set an instance name" --set-by "sampleapp developer"
```

```shell
$ kpt cfg create-setter sampleapp/ image nginx:1.16.1 --field "image" --description "use to set image for component" --set-by "sampleapp developer"
```

Then the app operator could see which parameters are available in this component like below:

```shell
$ kpt cfg list-setters sampleapp/
  NAME              VALUE               SET BY                   DESCRIPTION             COUNT
  image           nginx:1.16.1        sampleapp developer   use to set image for component   1
  instance-name   example-component   sampleapp developer   use to set an instance name      1
```

It's very clear and easy to understand.

#### Set Value by App Operator

Then the application operator could set `instance-name` with a new name like this:

```shell
$ kpt cfg set sampleapp/ instance-name test-component
set 1 fields
```

Check the component and you will find the instane name has been changed.

```shell
$ cat sampleapp/component.yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: test-component # {"$ref":"#/definitions/io.k8s.cli.setters.instance-name"}
spec:
  parameters:
  - name: instance-name
    fieldPaths:
    - metadata.name
...
```

### App Overview

With kpt, you could see an overview of your App.

```shell
$ kpt cfg count sampleapp
ApplicationConfiguration: 1
Component: 1
```

So in the sampleapp, we have one ApplicationConfiguration and Component.

### Live apply

kpt includes the next-generation **apply** commands developed out of the Kubernetes [cli-utils](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils) repository as the [`kpt live apply`](https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/reference/live/apply) command.

This means with `kpt live apply` command, we could wait for the controller reconcile.

```shell
$ kpt live init sampleapp
Initialized: ../sampleapp/grouping-object-template.yaml
```

```shell
$ kpt live apply sampleapp --wait-for-reconcile
configmap/grouping-object-a4e18a93 created
applicationconfiguration.core.oam.dev/example-appconfig configured
component.core.oam.dev/test-component created
3 resource(s) applied. 2 created, 0 unchanged, 1 configured
configmap/grouping-object-a4e18a93 is Current: Resource is always ready
applicationconfiguration.core.oam.dev/example-appconfig is Current: Resource is current
resources failed to the reached Current status
configmap/grouping-object-a4e18a93 pruned
2 resource(s) pruned
```

Currently `kpt live apply` seems not work well and will be fixed soon by [issue #498](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/issues/498).

Happly building OAM apps with kpt!
