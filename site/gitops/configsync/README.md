# Config Sync

Config Sync lets cluster operators and platform administrators deploy consistent
configurations and policies. You can deploy these configurations and policies to
individual Kubernetes clusters, multiple clusters that can span hybrid and
multi-cloud environments, and multiple namespaces within clusters. This process
simplifies and automates configuration and policy management at scale.
Config Sync also lets development teams independently manage their
namespaces within clusters, while still being subject to policy guardrails set
by administrators.

Config Sync is an open-source project and the source and releases available at
[github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt-config-sync](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt-config-sync).
It also provides instructions for installing Config Sync on your cluster and
building it from source.
