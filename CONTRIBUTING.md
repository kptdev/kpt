# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Contributing large features

Larger features and all the features that affect the interface (CLI or API) of
kpt need to have a reviewed and merged design document.  It is OK to start with
a prototype in your private fork but if you intend for your feature to be
shipped in kpt please create a design document with this 
[design template](/docs/design-docs/00-template.md).

You should create a copy of the template and submit a PR for comments and 
review by maintainers.  Once the PR is merged the design is considered approved.
The actual code change PRs should link to the design documents, even though it
is well understood that the design can drift during implementation.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help] for more
information on using pull requests.

## Community Guidelines

## Contribution to the Functions Catalog

Refer to the
[documentation in the kpt-functions-catalog](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt-functions-catalog/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
repo.

## Contributing to Documentation

If you are updating the documentation, please do it in separate PRs from code
changes and PR description should start with `Docs:`.

### Run the docs locally

Make docs changes and test them by running the site in a docker container with
`make site-run-server`.

It's usually a good idea to test locally for the following:

- Broken links
- Rendering static content

### Update docs

Docs are under [site/] and use [docsify] to present the source markdown files.
The sidebar is automatically updated for the site at deployment time.

### Docs Hygiene

The kpt website uses markdownlint to lint docs for formatting and style. Use
prettier with the `"prettier.proseWrap": "always"` setting to auto-format docs
in VSCode.

This includes:

- Lint docs with markdownlint to standardize them and make them easier to
  update.
- Run the kpt website through the [W3 Link Checker] in recursive mode and fix
  warnings and errors.
