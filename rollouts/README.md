# Rollouts

Rollouts is a component for deploying KRM configuration to multiple kubernetes clusters.

You can run Rollouts:

* On GKE (getting started guide coming soon)
* [Locally](./docs/running-locally.md), intended primarily for [development](./docs/development.md)

If you already have rollouts installed, there is a user guide coming soon.
