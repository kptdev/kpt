# Adding 'configsync.gke.io/deletion-propagation-policy: Foreground' will result in
# managed objects being cleaned up by Config Sync when the RootSync object created
# by the rollout is deleted. As a note, this is not included in any release tag (as
# of the release date of v1.14.2), and to use this, you must build Config Sync from
# HEAD.
