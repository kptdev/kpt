# kpt

kpt is a package-centric toolchain that enables a WYSIWYG configuration 
authoring, automation, and delivery experience, which simplifies managing
Kubernetes platforms and KRM-driven infrastructure at scale by manipulating
declarative Configuration as Data, separated from the code that transforms it.

## Why kpt?

kpt enables WYSIWYG editing and interoperable automation applied to declarative
configuration data, similar to how the live state can be modified with imperative
tools. 

See [the rationale](https://kpt.dev/guides/rationale) for more background.
